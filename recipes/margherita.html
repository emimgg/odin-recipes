    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> 3 1/2 cups, all-purpose</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> 1 cup</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> 1 pinch</li>
        <li><strong>Pizza Sauce:</strong> 2 cups</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> 20 slices of fresh mozzarella</li>
        <li><strong>Basil:</strong> 20 leaves</li>
        <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> To taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside. </li>
        <li>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. </li>
        <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball. </li>
        <li>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place 5 basil leaves on top. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls. </li>
        <li>Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
